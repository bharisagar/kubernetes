# Kubernetes Zero To Hero

A practical Kubernetes learning repository focused on real-world workflows, clear architecture notes, and repeatable hands-on labs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Explain Kubernetes architecture and core components.
- Deploy workloads using YAML manifests.
- Use labels and selectors to group and filter resources.
- Expose applications with Kubernetes Services and Ingress.
- Manage replicas using ReplicaSets and Deployments.
- Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling with Metrics Server.
- Add liveness and readiness probes.
- Package Kubernetes applications with Helm.
- Apply basic RBAC permissions using Roles and RoleBindings.
- Explain Kubernetes Pod, Service, DNS, CNI, ingress, and egress networking.
- Manage configuration using ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- Use basic Kubernetes storage with volumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.
- Debug common pod and cluster issues.

Helm chart: final-project/helm/shopsphere
Debug manifests: toolbox, bad Service selector, missing Secret, bad readiness probe
```

## Quick Start

Start the local Kubernetes cluster:

```powershell
minikube start --driver=docker
```

Verify cluster access:

```powershell
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
```

Run the Day 5 project with raw manifests:

```powershell
minikube addons enable ingress
kubectl apply -f day5/manifests/00-namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f day5/manifests/01-payments-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f day5/manifests/02-payments-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f day5/manifests/03-orders-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f day5/manifests/04-orders-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f day5/manifests/05-frontend-replicaset.yaml
kubectl apply -f day5/manifests/06-ingress.yaml
kubectl apply -f day5/manifests/07-egress-test-pod.yaml
kubectl get all -n day5
kubectl get ingress -n day5
```

Run the Day 5 project with Helm:

```powershell
helm template day5-web day5/helm/day5-ecommerce
helm install day5-web day5/helm/day5-ecommerce
helm list -n day5
helm upgrade day5-web day5/helm/day5-ecommerce --set replicaCount=3
helm history day5-web -n day5
helm rollback day5-web 1 -n day5
helm uninstall day5-web -n day5
```

Clean up Day 5:

```powershell
kubectl delete namespace day5 --ignore-not-found=true
minikube addons disable ingress
minikube stop
```

Run the Day 6 School Portal networking lesson:

Follow the [teacher-style Day 6 guide](day6/README.md) for architecture diagrams, explained YAML, predicted results, and the staged NetworkPolicy experiment. Start a separate profile:

```powershell
minikube start -p day6-networking --driver=docker --cni=calico
kubectl config use-context day6-networking
```

Continue with project step 2 in the guide. Create the backend Service before the frontend, and apply policies only when you reach the policy exercise.

Clean up Day 6:

```powershell
kubectl --context day6-networking delete namespace day6 --ignore-not-found=true
minikube stop -p day6-networking
```

Run the Day 7 ConfigMaps, Secrets, storage, and debugging practical:

```powershell
minikube start --driver=docker
kubectl apply -f day7/manifests/00-namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f day7/manifests/01-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f day7/manifests/02-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f day7/manifests/03-pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f day7/manifests/04-config-secret-storage-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f day7/manifests/05-emptydir-pod.yaml
kubectl get all -n day7
kubectl get pvc -n day7
kubectl describe pod -n day7 -l app=config-storage-demo
kubectl logs -n day7 -l app=config-storage-demo
```

Run the Day 7 debugging examples one at a time:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f day7/debug/01-imagepullbackoff.yaml
kubectl describe pod imagepull-error-demo -n day7
kubectl get events -n day7 --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
kubectl delete -f day7/debug/01-imagepullbackoff.yaml
```

Clean up Day 7:

```powershell
kubectl delete namespace day7 --ignore-not-found=true
minikube stop
```

Run the final ShopSphere capstone project:

```powershell
minikube delete
minikube start --driver=docker --cni=calico
minikube addons enable ingress
minikube addons enable metrics-server
kubectl apply -f final-project/manifests
kubectl rollout status deployment/frontend -n shopsphere --timeout=180s
kubectl rollout status deployment/orders-api -n shopsphere --timeout=180s
kubectl rollout status deployment/payments-api -n shopsphere --timeout=180s
kubectl rollout status statefulset/postgres -n shopsphere --timeout=180s
kubectl get all -n shopsphere
kubectl get ingress,hpa,pdb,networkpolicy -n shopsphere
minikube service frontend -n shopsphere --url
```

Run the final project with Helm:

```powershell
helm template shopsphere final-project/helm/shopsphere
helm install shopsphere final-project/helm/shopsphere
helm list -n shopsphere
helm upgrade shopsphere final-project/helm/shopsphere --set replicaCount.orders=3
helm history shopsphere -n shopsphere
helm rollback shopsphere 1 -n shopsphere
helm uninstall shopsphere -n shopsphere
```

Clean up the final project:

```powershell
kubectl delete -f final-project/debug --ignore-not-found=true
kubectl delete -f final-project/manifests --ignore-not-found=true
kubectl delete namespace shopsphere --ignore-not-found=true
minikube stop
```
